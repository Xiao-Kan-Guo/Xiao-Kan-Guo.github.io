I am a mathematical physicist.

I am now teaching in the Department of Applied Mathemetics at [YCIT](https://www.ycit.cn/). 

I am interested in various topics in Mathematical Physics and Theoretical Physics, including special topics from quantum gravity, quantum information theory, and quantum many-body physics.
